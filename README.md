# Node.js dojo
In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of Node and explore its applications in developing scalable network applications.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you will need to install the following software on your local machine:

* [Node v8](https://nodejs.org/en/) (*which includes [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)*)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (*recommended for people in Bath due to proxy issues*)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

The tutorial also assumes:

* you understand basic JavaScript and have an awareness of [ES6](http://es6-features.org) features.
* you are working on Windows OS (*there are slight differences in the implementation of Node on Linux*).

## Setting up your environment

Let's create a directory in which to store the examples you will work with in this tutorial. Open up an instance of Command Prompt and paste the following (*replacing with a suitable directory of your choice if you wish*):

```bash
mkdir "C:/Projects/NodeJsDojo"
code "C:/Projects/NodeJsDojo"
```

You can press `Ctrl + '` to open up the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code and use this for our commands. Pressing `Ctrl + \` splits the terminal into multiple sessions, whilst `Ctrl + Shift + '` opens a new terminal in the dropdown terminal list. You can close any unnecessary terminals by entering the command:
```bash
exit
```
More handy shortcuts can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal).

Now that you're familiar with the terminal in Visual Studio Code, let's check you have installed Node correctly by entering the command:
```bash
node --version
```
You should see a version number in the format of `v8.x.x`

## What actually is Node?

Put simply, Node is a free, open source, cross-platform server environment. It runs in a single thread, and uses non-blocking, asynchronous programming so it can handle multiple requests simultaneously via events. It is fundamentally a JavaScript runtime environment, but is a lot more than just JavaScript - there is also a lot of C++ and C behind the scenes!

Let's have a look at the architecture behind Node - here's a general layout:

![Node's architecture](./images/1-NodeArchitecture.png)

Node consists of 3 primary building blocks:
* **[V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/)** - Google's high-performance JavaScript engine, written in C++ and used in Google Chrome. It is effectively a VM that can be used to run JavaScript code. Node uses this by default, but it is possible to configure it to use Microsoft's ChakraCore engine that powers Edge instead - see [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore).
* **[Libuv](https://libuv.org/)** - A high performance, cross platform evented I/O library written in C. In Node, an event loop is used to push callbacks to the runtime call stack so that asynchronous responses can be processed - more on this later.
* **[JS, C++](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/meta/topics/dependencies/)** - Other code libraries for HTTP parsing, handling DNS requests, cryptographic functions and file compression/decompression.

To understand some of these concepts better, let's play around with some commands in Node.
